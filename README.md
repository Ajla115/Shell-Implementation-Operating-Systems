### Question 1: If we have a single-core, uniprocessor system that supports multiprogramming, how many processes can be in a running state in such a system, at any given  time?
# 
In a single-core, uniprocessor system that supports multiprogramming, the CPU time is divided among various tasks, enabling them to operate simultaneously. Every process is given a time window, or quantum, in which to carry out its operations. There can only be one process running at a time on a single-core, uniprocessor system that supports multiprogramming. However, several processes may be in a "running" or "ready" state while they wait for the CPU to execute them. The individual operating system and the available system resources, such as CPU speed, memory, and I/O bandwidth, determine the maximum number of processes that can be active at any given time
